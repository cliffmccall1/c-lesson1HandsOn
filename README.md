# Requirements for CSharp 1 Hands On

## Directions

For your Lesson 1 Hands-On, you will be practicing your new C# skills writing variables with data types as well as if statements. In this Hands-On exercise, you will create a program which will test your newly acquired knowledge of C# programming. This Hands-On will be graded, so be sure you complete all three parts listed below. Follow the below steps for setup.

## Part 1

For this Hands-On, you are going to be writing variables and if-else statements to inform the user if they need to wear sunglasses or not.

Create a variable named **isSunny** with the value of **true**.
Define this variable with the correct data type.
Hint! What data type is set to either true or false?

Create two new variables:
**wear** which should be set to the string value _"Wear sunglasses!"_
**dontWear** which should be set to the string value _"You don't need to wear sunglasses."_
Convert the following statements into the necessary C# if-else statements:
If it is sunny outside, print _"Wear sunglasses!"_. If it is anything else, print _"You don't need to wear sunglasses."_
You must use each of the three variables created.

Hint! Each of the examples within this lesson "print" to the console.

Run this within your integrated terminal. The console output should look like the following:
_Wear sunglasses!_

## Part 2

Create an additional variable named **atBeach** that is set to true and has the correct data type.
Create two new variables:
**sunblock** to contain the sentence _"Sunblock is a good idea."_
**noSunblock** to contain the sentence _"Sunblock isn't needed."_
Add another if-else statement that will execute if the variable **isSunny** is true (you already created that if-else statement in Part 1). If **isSunny** is false, this new if-else will not be executed. This new if-else statement will check if the variable **atBeach** is true/false.
If it is true, print _"Sunblock is a good idea."_
If it is false, print _"No need to wear sunblock."_
You must use each of the above variables.
Run the program and your console output should look like the following:
_Wear sunglasses!_
_Sunblock is a good idea._

## Part 3

Create three new variables:
**goTomorrow** that is set to true.
**going** to contain the sentence _"Awesome! Glad you don't mind clouds!"_
**nextTime** to contain the sentence _"No worries! Hopefully next time we will have some sun!"_
Add another if-else statement that will execute if the variable **isSunny** is false. This new if-else statement should check if the variable **goTomorrow** is true.

If it is true, print _"Awesome! Glad you don't mind clouds!"_
If it is false, print _"No worries! Hopefully next time we will have some sun!"_

Use the above variables.

Change the definition of **isSunny** such that its value is false.
Run the program. You should now see the following:

_You don't need to wear sunglasses._
_Awesome! Glad you don't mind clouds!_
